⭐️ 1. Lead Research AI (adds context before emailing)
Your agent will:
take name + company
search web / LinkedIn style cues
extract pain points
personalize email
This becomes a 2-step agent:
1️⃣ Research lead
2️⃣ Generate outreach
⭐️ 2. Follow-up Drip AI
Your agent will generate:
3-day follow-up
7-day follow-up
14-day follow-up
All automatically stored in DB.
⭐️ 3. Email Sending Automation
Instead of dry-run:
send real emails through Gmail API
add tracking pixel
track opens + replies
⭐️ 4. CRM Auto-update
After sending:
“contacted”
“email opened”
“follow-up scheduled”
⭐️ 5. Multi-Agent Brain
3 AI modules:
Research agent
Outreach agent
Followup agent
⭐️ 6. Add LLM-based Lead Scoring
Model predicts:
warm lead
cold lead
decision-maker score
⭐️ 7. Full n8n Integration
So the same SDR agent is available for non-coders too.
